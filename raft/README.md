# Raft Consensus Algorithm

The Raft consensus algorithm is a protocol designed to ensure fault-tolerance and leader election in distributed systems. It provides a reliable and efficient mechanism for coordinating activities among a cluster of nodes.

## Introduction
In a distributed system, where multiple nodes work together to achieve a common goal, it is crucial to have a mechanism that ensures consistency and fault-tolerance. The Raft consensus algorithm addresses these challenges by electing a leader and maintaining consensus across the cluster.

## Leader Election
Raft employs a leader election process to determine which node will act as the leader. The leader is responsible for handling client requests, replicating data to other nodes, and maintaining consistency within the system. If the leader fails or becomes unavailable, a new leader needs to be elected through the Raft election algorithm.

## Heartbeat Mechanism
To monitor the health of the leader and detect failures, each node in the system has its own internal clock. Nodes randomly choose a timeout value within a specific range. During normal operation, a node sends out "heartbeat" messages to other nodes to indicate that it is still active and functioning properly. If a node does not receive any heartbeat message from the leader within its timeout period, it assumes that something might have gone wrong with the leader.

## RequestVote Message
When a node suspects a problem with the leader, it starts an election by sending a special message called a "RequestVote" to all other nodes in the system. Upon receiving a RequestVote, a node checks whether it has already voted in this term. If it hasn't voted for anyone yet and agrees that the requesting node is eligible to become the leader (based on the requesting node's log information), it grants its vote by sending a "Vote" message back.

## Leader Election Result
If a candidate receives votes from the majority of the nodes, it becomes the new leader for the next term. It notifies everyone about its victory by sending "AppendEntries" messages, indicating that it is the new leader and others should follow it.

## Consensus Maintenance
Once a node receives the AppendEntries message from a valid leader, it resets its timer and recognizes the new leader as the authority. The leader continues to send periodic heartbeat messages to maintain its leadership and keep the system running smoothly.

By employing the Raft consensus algorithm, distributed systems can achieve fault-tolerance, leader election, and consistency, ensuring reliable operation even in the presence of failures.
